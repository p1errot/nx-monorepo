## Development server

To run all applications at once for dev server, run `nx run-many --target=serve --all=true`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `nx serve nest-micro` for a api dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. 

Run `nx serve admin` for a angular dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.

Run `nx serve client` for a react dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:3500/.

To update any application port, update `project.json` config file located in the app root folder and navigate to the following path:
```json
{
  "targets": {
    "serve": {
      "options": {
        "port": "<number>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
